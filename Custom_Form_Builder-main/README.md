# **Custom Form Builder with MERN Stack**

This project is a custom form builder application that allows users to create forms with three unique question types: Categorize, Cloze, and Comprehension. The frontend is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), and Tailwind CSS is used for styling.

## **Features**

- Create and edit custom forms
- Add images to questions and a header image
- Preview forms before saving
- Responses are stored in the MongoDB database with proper schemas

## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: **`npm install`**
3. Run backend server: **`npm run server`**
4. Run frontend: **`npm start`**

## ****Inspiration****

The UI design of the form builder takes inspiration from various form builders like Typeform and Paperform while incorporating innovative elements.

I would like to thank BoloForms and Auto Proctor for inspiring this project.
